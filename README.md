Common Data Structures and Algorithms

In order to build my Computer Science foundation, I have been learning data structures and common algorithms in my spare time.
The two resources I use most frequently are the [*Geeks for Geeks* website](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)  and the excellent book *The Algorithm Design Manual* by Steven Skiena.

As stated these are implemented in low-level C for now and I plan to reconstruct them in JavaScript later on.
