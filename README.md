### Data-Structures

It is easy to take for granted the tools that higher-level languages provide us. Key among these are data structures. Ever wonder how these tools work? What abstract data types they use for storage? How operations are implemeted?

No? Well I have! And that curiosity led me to building them myself. Reverse engineering is the best way to understand something after all!

Note: this repo is a work in progress. I am still adding more advanced structures to it, and updating old code to C++.

Enjoy and thanks for stopping by!
