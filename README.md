### Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

It is easy to take for granted the tools that higher-level languages provide us. Key among these are data structures. Ever wonder how these tools work? Why the work?

Reverse engineering is the best way to *truly* understand how something works. Here, we'll focus on how popular standard library sata structures are implemented. This repo is by no means a perfect representation, it is only my take on the subject.

Enjoy!
